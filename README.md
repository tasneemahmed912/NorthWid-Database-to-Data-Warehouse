# ETL_NorthWind
Northwind Database to Data Warehouse Conversion
Overview
This project involves converting the Northwind database, which is a sample database for Microsoft Access, to a data warehouse using ETL 
(Extract, Transform, Load) in Microsoft SQL Server. The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data analysis and reporting
by creating a central repository for integrated, high-quality data.

Approach
We used Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to perform ETL operations on the Northwind database.
We first extracted data from the Northwind database and transformed it by cleaning, standardizing, and enriching the data. We also created data models and hierarchies to facilitate data analysis and reporting.

We then loaded the transformed data into the data warehouse, which is a central repository for integrated, high-quality data.
We also designed and implemented a data governance framework to ensure data quality, consistency, and security.

Conclusion
This project demonstrated the potential of ETL and data warehousing as tools for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of data analysis and reporting.
By converting the Northwind database to a data warehouse, we created a central repository for integrated, high-quality data that can be used for various purposes, 
such as business intelligence, data mining, and machine learning.

The code and results of this project can be found in this repository, and can be used as a starting point for further research on data warehousing and related topics.
